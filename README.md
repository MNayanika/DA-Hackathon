Step by step process
1.	Extraction: Loaded csv file into Power BI
2.	Transformation: Opened Power Query editor and performed data cleaning and transformation.
3.	Created Year and Month column in dim_date for easy analysis
4.	Created Days_Stayed column in fact_bookings to understand staying patterns
5.	Created metrics as per metrics list
6.	Visualization: Created card visuals to keep a check on the metrices, total revenue generated, average rating, occupancy percentage and cancellation rate.
7.	Added a funnel chart to understand the booking pattern of the hotels.
8.	Added a stacked column chart to understand which category of hotels are customers preferring. We can also drill down to understand the customer preference for city and respective hotels present in that city.
9.	Added a pie chart to understand the number of stays customers are spending in different categories of hotels
10.	Added a line chart to understand the revenue numbers for the hotels.
11.	Added a stacked bar chart to know the top booking platforms.
12.	Added a doughnut chart to find total revenue generated as per city.

Conclusions
1.	From point 7 we understand that the top 3 hotels that customers are choosing are GDS Palace, GDS Exotica and GDS City. Hence effective marketing, discounts and loyalty rewards in these hotels can help attract new customers and hold back the old ones.
2.	From point 8 we understand that customers are preferring luxury hotels more than business hotels. Hence effective marketing, discounts and loyalty rewards in these hotels can help attract more revenue. Also, any new projects in luxury category are expected to be more profitable.
3.	In point 9 we see that customer stays are longer in luxury hotels as compared to business hotels hence offers like discounted meals and room upgrades can help in making customers stay even longer.
4.	In point 10 we find the same hotels to be in the top 3 performers. 
5.	From point 11 we find the top 5 booking platforms for the hotels. Hence more promotions and offers should be redirected in these platforms.
6.	In point 12 we see that Mumbai and Bangalore are the top cities in terms of revenue generation. Hence more marketing and offers in these cities can help generate even more revenue. Also any new projects can also be more profitable in these locations than any other.
